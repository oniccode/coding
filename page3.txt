<h1>Personal Care!</h1>

<h2><u>The dream business</u></h2>
<p>The Dream business that I would like to start would be a personal care business. A lot of people need personal care products. It's a necessity for many people to look and smell good.</p>
<hr>
<h3><u>Why I want to do this business </u></h3>
<p>In all honesty, I would only want to do this business to make <strong>money</strong> off of it. It's a great way to make money because the majority of shoppers in today's world are women. Beauty/Personal care are top priority for most women. With the right audience and right products, you can create cash flow.</p>
<hr>
<h3><u>How I would start it</u></h3>
<p>I would start the business by creating a proffesional email for my business to organize all emails just for the business. Then I would use <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> to design my logo for my brand. Afterwards, I would go and create a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">shopify</a> store to organize products and prices. Lastly I would use my social media platforms (tiktok, youtube, instagram, etc.)</p>
